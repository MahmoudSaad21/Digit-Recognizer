# Digit Recognizer

Welcome to the Digit Recognizer project! In this project, we build a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The goal is to develop an accurate digit recognition model capable of classifying digits from 0 to 9 with high precision.

## Introduction
Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision. The MNIST dataset, consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits, serves as a benchmark for developing digit recognition algorithms. In this project, we leverage deep learning techniques to accurately classify these digits.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Project Highlights
- Setup the Kaggle environment and downloaded the MNIST dataset.
- Preprocessed the data, including loading, exploring, and visualizing the dataset.
- Built and trained a CNN model for digit recognition.
- Evaluated the model's performance on the validation set.
- Made predictions on the test set and visualized the results.

## Project Structure
The project repository is organized as follows:
```
- digit-recognizer.ipynb       # Jupyter Notebook containing the project code
- README.md                     # Project documentation
- requirements.txt		# This file lists all the Python packages and their versions required for running the project.
```

## Setup and Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MahmoudSaad21/digit-recognizer.git
   cd digit-recognizer
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open and run the `digit-recognizer.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment.

## Results
The trained model achieved impressive accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits, showcasing the power of deep learning in image classification tasks. Below is a summary of the model's performance:

| Metric            | Value    |
|-------------------|----------|
| Accuracy (Train)  | 0.995    |
| Accuracy (Test)   | 0.989    |
